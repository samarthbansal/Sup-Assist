# Sup-Assist
My first hackathon project

The purpose is making Supe's (Heroes) healthy and happy!!ðŸ˜ƒ

# What it does
Built it as a buddy/sidekick or a girlfriend/boyfriend (only if you are single XD) which will always be present for you, right in your mobile. Someone who won't judge you, rather just show you the coolest things on Earth (and maybe Pluto as well; everything is SUPER here), someone that will teach you good habits like exercising, eating a healthy diet and laughing. But whatever it does, it will be selflessly present to improve the quality of our heroe's (or everyone's) life.

I know there our some apps on Playstore and Appstore that try to solve this problem, but they are not able to fully accomplish it. Either they are too dull to be of any help in cheering up the user or they are so monotonous that the user has do download several of them.
